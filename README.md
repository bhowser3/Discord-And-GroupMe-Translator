# Discord-And-GroupMe-Translator
Send messages back and forth between GroupMe and Discord. 

The messages will come through on either end under a bots name with a "Sent: Author" message as well.

Basic code using NodeJS and some npm packages to send messages from a group me chat to a discord channel and vice versa. 
Images can be processed as well.
Currently there is no support for Gifs or other media types.
